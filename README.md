# DrupalPod Starter-kit

> Starter-kit for running a Drupal 9 website in Gitpod


## Getting started

1. Click the **Use this template** button in GitHub and follow the on-screen instructions to **Create a new repository**.

2. Once the repository has been generated, open it in Gitpod by appending `https://gitpod.io#` to the GitHub url.

   Example: `https://gitpod.io#github.com/drupalpod/drupalpod-starterkit`

   _Note:_ If this is your first time using Gitpod, you can signup for a free plan with your Github account.

3. Wait for your codebase to build.

   _Note:_ To speed up this step, enable Prebuilds by follow the instructions @ https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#enable-prebuilt-workspaces

4. Install your site: `ddev drush site-install`
